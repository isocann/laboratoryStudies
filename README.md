# Decision Tree and Random Forest with 3 tasks

Classification problems and how they can be approached using a category of tree-based models. In particular, you will use a decision tree from scikit-learn. You will see it in action with different datasets and understand its points of strength and weaknesses. Then, you will implement your own version of a random forest, starting from scikit-learnâ€™s decision trees.

The main library you will need is scikit-learn.
