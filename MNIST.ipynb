    ") pixels, and each pixel has a value that ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Figure 2 shows one such digit. The dataset can be downloaded from the following URL:\n",

The following 784 columns represent the grayscale image in row-major order. Keep in mind that, in this case, the digit label (i.e. the first column) is an integer from 0 to 9, while the following 784 values are integers between 0 and 255."
